We are very proud of the faculty and staff from the departments that comprise our college. All HHP classrooms now meet campus standards as &quot;smart classrooms&quot; and therefore the latest technology is available to all students and faculty.&nbsp; All HHP areas are wireless areas. We continue to develop a total learning environment.&nbsp; Please take time to become familiar with the depth of opportunities found in our college. Faculty are leaders in research, teaching and service for the region and nation. You will find WEB sites illustrating faculty contributions, research laboratories, and our many service opportunities. We believe in meeting the needs of the community and you will find many examples of applied research that seeks to expand the knowledge and applications that will enhance eastern North Carolina and beyond. The mission of the college is clear and the vision is for the faculty and students to have the best possible equipment and opportunities within an environment of intellectual stimulation. Creating this culture is our quest and we hope you will join us.</p>
