	<p>Upon receiving the sponsorship gift, an announcement is sent to the honoree or the family of the honoree notifying them of this great honor. The name(s) of the sponsor(s) is also included in the announcement. A request for biographical information and the inscription text is forwarded to the honoree or the family of the honoree. The inscription text is limited in size and is subject to review by the Deanâ€™s editorial Board. This information is used when the College of Health and Human Performance recognizes our honorees at the annual Wall of Fame Induction Ceremony which takes place every spring. The ceremony is followed by a reception.  A special insignia will be added to any honoree on the Wall of Fame if they are sponsored multiple times.</p>
